# CSS `calc()` Function Spacing Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `calc()` function in CSS: forgetting to include spaces around the operators.  The `calc()` function requires spaces around the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators for it to parse correctly. 

The `bug.css` file shows the incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.css` demonstrates the corrected version.
